== Description ==

Get more Twitter Followers with this Plugin! Bibs Twitter Follow Button Reloaded adds the official Twitter Follow Button with a Widget to your WordPress Blog to increase your readers engagement and create a connection with your Blog Readers. You can use as many widgets you want, all with different settings.

Or as an alternative you can Shortcodes like [tfb username='yourusername' count='true' lang='en' theme='light'] for light blue color or [tfb username='yourusername' count='true' lang='en' theme='dark'] for dark color. You can even mix widgets an Shortcodes.

The Widget offers more options than the Shortcode. You can use padding for better placement inside the widget and your own CSS for a border around the Button as example.

The Plugin works also with WP Multisite.

The Plugin is available in English and German!
